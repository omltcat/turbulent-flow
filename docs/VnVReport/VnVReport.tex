\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}	

This section will not be appropriate for every project.

\section{Changes Due to Testing}

\wss{This section should highlight how feedback from the users and from 
the supervisor (when one exists) shaped the final product.  In particular 
the feedback from the Rev 0 demo to the supervisor (or to potential users) 
should be highlighted.}

\section{Code Coverage Metrics}

Coverage is tested with pytest-cov, using the command shown in Section \ref{sec:AutomatedTesting} that executes unit and system tests. An overall coverage of 98\% is achieved, with coverage report is shown in Figure \ref{fig:coverage}. 

\begin{figure}[h!]

  \caption{Coverage report}
  \label{fig:coverage}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The only two modules that are not fully covered are \texttt{main} and \texttt{query}. The not covered lines are either related to exception handling with those exceptions already tested in lower level modules, or impossible to reach in automated testing (e.g. plot pop-up).

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Reflection.  Please answer the following question:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different
  from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
  differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why did
  these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
  projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly
  predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the
  evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that most
  teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)
\end{enumerate}
